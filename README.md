# Assembler and Simulator for Computer Architecture

This project is an **Assembler and Simulator** created as part of a **Computer Architecture** course. The assembler converts assembly language instructions into machine code, while the simulator executes the generated machine code, simulating the behavior of a CPU. 

## Features

### Assembler
- Converts human-readable assembly code into binary machine code.
- Supports a custom instruction set defined for the course.
- Validates syntax and checks for semantic errors in the assembly code.
- Provides meaningful error messages for debugging.

### Simulator
- Executes machine code generated by the assembler.
- Simulates registers, memory, and CPU operations.
- Supports basic debugging features such as:
  - Step-by-step execution.
  - Inspection of register and memory values.
- Displays output for specific instructions (e.g., print or halt).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler for C programs.
- Basic understanding of assembly language and computer architecture concepts.

### Compilation Command
To compile the assembler executable, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc -o build/assembler_executable \
src/main.c \
src/memory/memory.c \
src/instructions/instructions.c \
src/registers/registers.c \
src/utils/utils.c
